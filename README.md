# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
1. Retrieve Weather Data
2. Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
3. Create a Travel Itinerary Map

### Summary
This challenge had me use my knowledge of API's from the modules to create and use Googles API and Weather Date to create a vacation itinerary. For this itinerary I choose Brazil for my client. I choose to keep the client on the coast to enjoy the beautiful beaches of Brazil with one stop on the itinerary inland so they could experience the forrests of Brazil. All in all this challenge was interesting and got me used to utilizing the documentation to create many maps and travel routes.
